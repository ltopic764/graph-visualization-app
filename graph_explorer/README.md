# Graph Explorer (Django Skeleton)

This component currently contains a minimal Django web skeleton and placeholder UI for the graph explorer layout.

## How to run

1. Activate virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
2. Install Django: `pip install Django`
3. From `graph_explorer/`, start server: `python manage.py runserver`

## Notes

- Only skeleton/layout is implemented in this issue.
- TODO: integrate platform/plugins and real graph rendering in later issues.
